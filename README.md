# Airline-Management-Simulation
This project implements multiple hash tables to manage airline-related data efficiently. The hash tables cover planes, plane types, plane seats, passengers, reservations, flight legs, flight instances, airports, and pilots. Each hash table uses an appropriate hashing strategy and collision resolution method for optimal data access.
